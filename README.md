# Todo Application

## Project Description and Features

The Todo Application is a modern, responsive web app built with React 19+ to manage tasks efficiently. It leverages the JSONPlaceholder API for todo data and includes advanced features for task management. The app is designed with a professional aesthetic using a blue-gray palette (`hsl(227, 35%, 25%)` shades) and a distinctive darker shades background for the "Add Todo" page and the header.

### Key Features

- **Pagination**: Navigate through todo lists with a "Next" button, supporting client-side pagination.
- **Offline Support**: Cache todo data for offline CRUD and filtering using Tanstack Query.
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation support for all components.
